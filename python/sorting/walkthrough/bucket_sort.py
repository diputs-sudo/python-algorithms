Bucket Sort Algorithm

Bucket Sort is a distribution based sorting algorithm.

How it works:
- It divides elements into several groups called buckets.
- Each bucket holds values within a specific range.
- Elements are distributed into buckets based on their value.
- Each bucket is sorted individually.
- All buckets are combined to produce the final sorted list.

This algorithm performs well when the input values are evenly distributed.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: O(n + k)
- Best Case: O(n + k)

Here n is the number of elements and k is the number of buckets.

Space Complexity:
- O(n + k) due to bucket storage.

Stability:
- Depends on the sorting method used inside each bucket.
