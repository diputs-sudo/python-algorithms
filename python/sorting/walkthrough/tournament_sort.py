"""
Tournament Sort Algorithm

Tournament Sort is a comparison based sorting algorithm inspired by
a knockout tournament structure.

How it works:
- Elements are placed in the leaves of a binary tree.
- Each internal node stores the minimum of its two children.
- The root always contains the smallest element in the structure.
- The minimum element is extracted and replaced with infinity.
- The tree is updated from the leaf to the root.
- The process repeats until all elements are extracted.

This approach simulates repeatedly selecting the minimum efficiently.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Best Case: O(n log n)

Space Complexity:
- O(n) due to the tournament tree structure.

Stability:
- Not stable in general.
