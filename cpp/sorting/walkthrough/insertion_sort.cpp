/*
Insertion Sort Algorithm

Insertion Sort is a simple comparison based sorting algorithm.

How it works:
- It builds the sorted list one element at a time.
- It takes the next element and compares it with elements before it.
- Larger elements are shifted to the right.
- The current element is inserted into its correct position.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n) when the list is already sorted.

Space complexity:
- O(1) since it sorts in place.
