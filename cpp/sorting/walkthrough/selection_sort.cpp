/*
Selection Sort Algorithm

Selection Sort is a simple comparison based sorting algorithm.

How it works:
- It divides the list into a sorted portion and an unsorted portion.
- It repeatedly finds the smallest element from the unsorted portion.
- It swaps that element with the first unsorted position.
- The sorted portion grows one element at a time from the beginning.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: O(n^2)
- Best Case: O(n^2)

Space Complexity:
- O(1) since it sorts in place.
