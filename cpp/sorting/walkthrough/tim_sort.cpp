/*
TimSort Algorithm

TimSort is a hybrid sorting algorithm used in Python, Java, and many
other programming languages.

It combines ideas from insertion sort and merge sort.

How it works:
- The array is divided into small sections called runs.
- Each run is sorted using insertion sort.
- The sorted runs are merged together.
- Runs are merged repeatedly until the entire array is sorted.

This approach performs very well on real world data because
many datasets already contain partially sorted sequences.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Best Case: O(n) when the data is nearly sorted.

Space Complexity:
- O(n) due to merging operations.

Stability:
- Stable because merging preserves order of equal elements.

Note:
This is a simplified educational version.
The industrial implementation used in Python includes
additional optimizations such as natural run detection,
stack invariants, and galloping mode.
