/*
Radix Sort Algorithm

Radix Sort is a non comparison based sorting algorithm.

How it works:
- It processes numbers digit by digit.
- It groups numbers based on the current digit.
- It starts from the least significant digit.
- It moves toward the most significant digit.
- After processing all digits, the list becomes sorted.

This version uses base 10 buckets and works for non negative integers.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(d x (n + k))
- Average Case: O(d x (n + k))
- Best Case: O(d x (n + k))

Here n is the number of elements, d is the number of digits,
and k is the range of each digit which is 0 to 9 in base 10.

Space Complexity:
- O(n + k) due to bucket storage.

Stability:
- Stable when bucket collection preserves order.
