/*
Shell Sort Algorithm

Shell Sort is an optimization of insertion sort.

How it works:
- It starts by comparing elements that are far apart using a gap value.
- The gap is gradually reduced after each pass.
- Elements are partially sorted at each gap level.
- When the gap becomes 1, the algorithm performs a final insertion sort pass.

This approach moves elements closer to their correct positions early,
which improves performance compared to regular insertion sort.

Time Complexity:
- Worst Case: O(n^2)
- Average Case: depends on the gap sequence and is often around O(n^1.5)
- Best Case: better than O(n^2) depending on input and gap sequence

Space Complexity:
- O(1) since it sorts in place.

Stability:
- Not stable in general.
